Nick Burns is a Masters Student in CASHP. He is interested in the paleoecology of the mid to late Miocene. He is interested in looking at the context for primate speciation in terms of environmental and geologic change during this interval. This context provides insight into resource availability, competition over resources, changing climatic patterns, and the timing and causes of large-scale ecosystem changes that would have had an impact on primate speciation.
