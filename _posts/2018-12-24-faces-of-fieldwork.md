Fieldwork is one of the aspects of my job that I like the most. It always feels like an adventure to travel to some of the most remote places in the world to look for fossils. Fieldwork also comes with personal challenges: everything from physical discomfort to being away from loved ones for extended periods of time.

I started an outreach project called [Faces of Fieldwork](http://facesoffieldwork.com) to document the personal side of fieldwork. The idea is to focus on the people, not the places, and to document what it is actually like to do this kind of work. If you like the project, you can also contribute your own photos and stories directly!
