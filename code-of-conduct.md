All members of the GWU Human Paleoecology Lab agree to abide by certain core principles in our laboratory and in our fieldwork. These principles are laid out in this Code of Conduct. 

We are committed to making participation in research a positive and enriching experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, or religion.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by laboratory members in person and in online spaces include the use of sexual language or imagery, derogatory comments or personal attacks, trolling, public or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional conduct.

Any violations of GW's [Sexual and Gender-Based Harrasment](http://my.gwu.edu/files/policies/SexualHarassmentFINAL.pdf) policy will be immediately reported to GWU's Title IX coordinator.
